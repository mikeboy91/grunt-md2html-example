# Example with Grunt: from Markdown to HTML

Just a very easy example of how to use Grunt to convert a Markdown file to
an HTML file. Images and CSS files will be inlined.

I needed this for work so plenty of stuff is hardcoded and there is room for
improvement.

## Prerequisites

  - [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)
  - [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Build HTML

```
npm install
grunt build
```
